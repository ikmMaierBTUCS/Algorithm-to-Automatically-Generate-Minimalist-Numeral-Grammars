# Algorithm-to-Automatically-Generate-Minimalist-Numeral-Grammars
Combined Numeral Reinforcement Learning with CFG-to-MG algorithm to create 263 Minimalist Numeral Grammars in different languages.
See https://github.com/ikmMaierBTUCS/Numeral-Reinforcement-Learning and https://github.com/ikmMaierBTUCS/CFG-to-MG-algorithm

In 'Code.py' you find the function numberset2MG. When passing a language* to the function, the numeral words of the language are learned and finally presented as a Minimalist Grammar in Stabler(1997) style.
